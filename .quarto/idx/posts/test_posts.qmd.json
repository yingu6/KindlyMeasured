Why Calendar works surprisingly well\n\n- Calendar events already have **start** and **end**\n- Calendar is **synced** across iPhone/watch/mac automatically\n- Exporting `.ics` is standard\n- Each event can store the book title in `SUMMARY`\n- A dedicated calendar means the data stays clean (no mixing with real meetings)\n\n### The Shortcuts idea\n\n- Shortcut asks me to choose a book (from a list)\n- It creates a calendar event that starts now\n- The “end” time is set when I stop (either by editing, or via a second shortcut)\n- Event title contains the book name (I use a simple prefix like `Book1:` etc.)\n\nIf you want it even simpler, you can skip book IDs and just use the title.\n\n---\n\n## Data export: Calendar → `.ics` → R\n\nAt intervals (weekly/monthly), I export the dedicated calendar as an `.ics` file and bring it into R.\n\nIn the `.ics`, each event looks roughly like:\n\n- `DTSTART` (start datetime)\n- `DTEND` (end datetime)\n- `SUMMARY` (book label)\n- `UID`, `CREATED`, etc.\n\nIn R, I convert to a data frame and compute durations.\n\n---\n\n## Analysis in R\n\n###
