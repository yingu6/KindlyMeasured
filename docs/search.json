I like treating everyday life as something you can observe with both warmth and precision, so I often pair notes and reflections with simple data—time logs, progress trackers, and small experiments. Looking through a data lens helps me notice patterns I might otherwise miss, ask better questions, challenge myself gently, and understand this beautiful yet confusing world a little more clearly."

The goal is to end up with a clean, analysis-ready dataset where:\nAlong the way, I’ll point out what each source includes (and what it doesn’t), and show a few simple, general cleaning steps needed to line up book titles across the two exports.

    "text": "Exporting .ics from Calendar\nI use Google Calendar as my main calendar, and I’ve imported it into Apple Calendar so my Google calendars are available inside Shortcuts (via Apple’s Calendar integration). For the reading tracker, I created a dedicated calendar called Reading2026, which the shortcut uses to store each reading session as an event.\nIn this section, I’ll walk through exporting the .ics file from both Apple Calendar and Google Calendar, and briefly explain why I ended up using the Google export for the analysis that follows.\n\nExporting from Apple Calendar\nBoth Apple Calendar and Google Calendar let you export an entire calendar. In Apple Calendar, the exact UI varies slightly by macOS version, but the workflow is roughly the same:\n\nOpen the Calendar app on your Mac\n\nIn the left sidebar, find and select the dedicated calendar (e.g., Reading2026)\n\nUse the top menu: File → Export → Export… to save that calendar as an .ics file\n\n\n\nExport from Google Calendar\nExporting an .ics file from Google Calendar is also straightforward:\n\nOpen Google Calendar in a browser\n\nIn the left sidebar, hover over the calendar (e.g., Reading2026), click the ⋮ menu (or right-click) and choose Settings and sharing\n\nScroll to Export calendar and download the .ics file\n\n\n\nA small quirk: Apple vs. Google .ics data\nAfter importing both .ics files into R, I noticed that the Apple Calendar .ics sometimes includes extra rows/fields that are harder to parse cleanly and can introduce edge-case issues. I looked into this issue briefly but couldn’t find any documentation or discussions that explain what might have led to this issue.\nIn my case, the Google Calendar export was easier to work with. To keep things simple, I’ll use the Google Calendar .ics file as the example dataset for the importing and analysis steps in the rest of this post."

    "text": "Merge Calendar and Goodreads Datasets\n\nMatch calendar book names to Goodreads titles\nNow we’re ready for the key step: link the calendar reading logs to the Goodreads library.\nBecause calendar book names are manually typed, I recommend, when you create the book list in Shortcuts, keeping them as close as possible to the titles in Goodreads. However, Goodreads book titles can be long, including information like series and edition notes. So, I’m using a function to do the matching with the following rule:\nIf the cleaned calendar title is contained in the cleaned Goodreads title, treat it as a match candidate.\n\nfind_match_candidates &lt;- function(calendar_df, gr) {\n  calendar_titles &lt;- calendar_df %&gt;%\n    distinct(summary) %&gt;%\n    filter(!is.na(summary), summary != \"\") %&gt;%\n    transmute(\n      calendar_title = summary,\n      calendar_clean = clean_title(calendar_title)\n    )\n\n  candidates &lt;- calendar_titles %&gt;%\n    tidyr::crossing(\n      gr %&gt;% select(book_id, title, author, title_clean)\n    ) %&gt;%\n    filter(str_detect(title_clean, fixed(calendar_clean))) %&gt;%\n    arrange(calendar_title, title)\n\n  list(calendar_titles = calendar_titles, candidates = candidates)\n}\n\nThen, we use the following process to review the matches and/or mismatches.\n\nIf there is exactly 1 match, we can auto-link it.\nIf there are 0 matches, the calendar title likely needs to be edited (or mapped manually).\nIf there are multiple matches, it usually means the calendar title is too generic (e.g., a short substring that appears in more than one Goodreads title) or your Goodreads library still has multiple editions. In practice, if you keep your calendar title reasonably specific (and you’ve removed duplicates), this should rarely happen — but we’ll still handle it gracefully.\n\n\n\nbuild_title_map &lt;- function(calendar_df, gr) {\n  out &lt;- find_match_candidates(calendar_df, gr)\n  calendar_titles &lt;- out$calendar_titles\n  candidates &lt;- out$candidates %&gt;%\n    mutate(\n      # Simple tie-breakers (still easy to explain):\n      # 1) Exact match after cleaning\n      # 2) Starts-with match\n      # 3) Otherwise, contains match\n      match_rank = dplyr::case_when(\n        title_clean == calendar_clean ~ 1L,\n        stringr::str_starts(title_clean, calendar_clean) ~ 2L,\n        TRUE ~ 3L\n      ),\n      # Prefer the Goodreads title that is closest in length to the calendar title\n      extra_chars = nchar(title_clean) - nchar(calendar_clean)\n    )\n\n  # For each calendar title, figure out whether there is a single “best” match\n  best_summary &lt;- candidates %&gt;%\n    group_by(calendar_title) %&gt;%\n    summarise(\n      n_candidates = n(),\n      best_rank = min(match_rank),\n      best_extra = min(extra_chars[match_rank == min(match_rank)]),\n      n_best = sum(match_rank == best_rank & extra_chars == best_extra),\n      candidate_list = paste0(book_id, \" | \", title, collapse = \" ; \"),\n      .groups = \"drop\"\n    )\n\n  coverage &lt;- calendar_titles %&gt;%\n    left_join(best_summary, by = \"calendar_title\") %&gt;%\n    mutate(\n      n_candidates = dplyr::coalesce(n_candidates, 0L),\n      n_best = dplyr::coalesce(n_best, 0L),\n      status = case_when(\n        n_candidates == 0 ~ \"no match (edit calendar title OR map manually)\",\n        n_best == 1 ~ \"auto-match\",\n        TRUE ~ \"multiple matches (calendar title too generic OR multiple editions — review)\"\n      )\n    ) %&gt;%\n    arrange(desc(n_candidates == 0), desc(status != \"auto-match\"), calendar_title)\n\n  # Auto-map only when there is exactly one best match\n  auto_map &lt;- candidates %&gt;%\n    inner_join(\n      best_summary %&gt;% filter(n_best == 1) %&gt;%\n        select(calendar_title, best_rank, best_extra),\n      by = \"calendar_title\"\n    ) %&gt;%\n    filter(match_rank == best_rank, extra_chars == best_extra) %&gt;%\n    arrange(calendar_title, match_rank, extra_chars, book_id) %&gt;%\n    transmute(\n      calendar_title,\n      book_id,\n      goodreads_title = title,\n      match_method = \"contained-in (ranked)\"\n    )\n\n  manual_map_template &lt;- coverage %&gt;%\n    filter(status != \"auto-match\") %&gt;%\n    transmute(\n      calendar_title,\n      book_id = NA_integer_,\n      goodreads_title = NA_character_,\n      match_method = \"manual\",\n      note = status\n    )\n\n  list(\n    coverage = coverage,\n    candidates = candidates,\n    auto_map = auto_map,\n    manual_map_template = manual_map_template\n  )\n}\n\nmatch_out &lt;- build_title_map(calendar_df, goodreads_dedup)\n\nknitr::kable(match_out$coverage)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncalendar_title\ncalendar_clean\nn_candidates\nbest_rank\nbest_extra\nn_best\ncandidate_list\nstatus\n\n\n\n\nGuns, Germs, and Steel\nguns germs and steel\n1\n2\n29\n1\n900007 | Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies\nauto-match\n\n\nProject Hail Mary\nproject hail mary\n1\n1\n0\n1\n900004 | Project Hail Mary (Hardcover)\nauto-match\n\n\nThe Kite Runner\nthe kite runner\n1\n1\n0\n1\n900002 | The Kite Runner\nauto-match\n\n\nThe Secret History\nthe secret history\n1\n1\n0\n1\n900006 | The Secret History (Vintage Classics)\nauto-match\n\n\nThe Story of A New Name\nthe story of a new name\n1\n1\n0\n1\n900001 | The Story of a New Name (Neapolitan Novels, #2)\nauto-match\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf anything shows up as “no match” or “multiple matches”, we’ll manually specify the mapping.

    "text": "Reflections\nFirst, Goodreads lets me retrieve plenty of information about my library—titles, authors, shelves/status, ratings, and dates. But the usefulness of that export depends on how consistently I keep it up to date. If I don’t regularly mark books as read or currently-reading, or if I rarely add ratings, the export ends up being mostly book metadata with limited insight into my actual reading experience.\nSecond, Goodreads still misses a few pieces that I personally care about. It doesn’t include reading progress (like percentage or pages) in the export—even though you can enter progress while reading. Also, there isn’t a “genre” field. As I looked into this, I realized a book can be labeled with many genres on Goodreads, which makes genre harder to use consistently in analysis, even if it’s available in the export.\nIn comparison, my tracker’s data (the Calendar data) is much smaller and more manageable. My goal is to keep this tracker clean and easy to maintain, so that when I get to the analysis step later, I’m working with data that’s straightforward to filter, summarize and link to the Goodreads data.\n\n\nThis work is licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0"

But neither gives me the kind of session-level data (or metadata) I want to understand my reading habits over time.\nWhat I really wanted was a simple tracker that could capture:\nAfter looking into what was already available, I found that popular reading tracker apps (like Bookly and Bookmory) still didn’t fully meet my needs—both in design and in how accessible the data was—unless I paid for a subscription. And since the data I wanted felt fairly minimal, I started wondering: could I build something lightweight that stays local and gives me full control?\nAfter talking it through with ChatGPT, I decided to try a route that’s already built into the Apple ecosystem: Shortcuts, which works across iPhone and Apple Watch.\nThis post documents the path I took—complete with a few zigzags—the setup that actually stuck, and the reflections I had along the way."

    "text": "Attempt 1: Shortcuts + Notes (works, but messy)\nMy first prototype used Shortcuts to append reading logs into Apple Notes. It worked, but Notes has an important limitation in this context: each appended value becomes its own line. That means a single session quickly turns into multiple lines—book title, start time, stop time, plus separators to keep the log readable (and editable if I logged something wrong).\nBelow is what the raw data looked like after a few iterations:\n\n\n\nBook: The Story of a New Name\nStart at\n2025-12-29T18:28:27-05:00\nStop at\n2025-12-29T18:28:30-05:00\n------\nBook: Kite Runner\nStart at\n2025-12-29T18:39:24-05:00\nStop at\n2025-12-29T18:39:29-05:00\n------\nBook: The Story of a New Name\nStart at\n2025-12-29T19:28:27-05:00\nStop at\n2025-12-29T19:28:30-05:00\n------\n\n\nFrom a data perspective, this wasn’t too bad. If I logged one reading session per day, I’d end up with roughly 365 × 6 = 2,190 lines by the end of the year. In theory, I could copy the note into R and run a parsing script built around this structure.\nStill, my data instincts kept nagging at me: this can’t be the best way. The format felt not only rudimentary but also fragile—easy to break if I ever tweaked the wording, missed a line, or wanted to add one more field later.\nSo I kept digging and tried another approach."

    "text": "Attempt 2: Shortcuts + Numbers/Excel (not working on Apple Watch)\nNext I tried a more “structured data” approach. I found a Reddit post that shared a work time-tracking workflow built with Shortcuts, which logs entries directly into a spreadsheet. I used that idea as a starting point and adapted it for reading.\nIts main difference from the Notes prototype is that Numbers becomes the database. Instead of writing raw text that I’d need to parse later, each session becomes a row in a spreadsheet—already structured, readable, and editable.\nI was able to quickly modify the shortcut to fit my needs. Here is the updated shortcut. In the Numbers file, I used three sheets to collect raw inputs and then clean the data:\n- Start: logs the book title + start timestamp\n- End: logs the stop timestamp\n- Time Tracking: uses formulas to join the two logs, cleans up the fields, and calculates duration per session.\n\nWhy this was appealing\n\nThe data was immediately tidy: rows and columns, no parsing required.\nIt was easy to review and correct mistakes.\nIn theory, I could even do lightweight summaries inside Numbers.\n\n\n\nWhy I didn’t stick with it\nThis approach mostly worked—but it failed one of my core constraints. - Too much friction on the phone. Every time I ran the shortcut, Numbers popped open on my iPhone, and I had to manually close it. These two steps are rather redundant. - Dealbreaker: it doesn’t work on Apple Watch. Numbers isn’t available on Apple Watch, so the shortcut can’t run there. And since I often read without my phone nearby, Watch-first logging wasn’t optional for me.\nAt this point, I was tempted to fall back to the Notes method—until I found a better alternative."

    "section": "Final Approach: Shortcuts + Calendar (finally works!)",
    "text": "Final Approach: Shortcuts + Calendar (finally works!)\nWhile browsing more time-tracking workflows on Reddit, I came across an idea I hadn’t seriously considered: tracking time by creating Calendar events. My first reaction was that it felt like an unnecessary extra system. But when I was describing my experiments to my husband, it finally clicked—Calendar could be the database. I already use it extensively, it’s available on Apple Watch, and it stores start/end timestamps natively. Better yet, I could export everything later and analyze it in R.\nThis ended up being the simplest solution—while also offers much more than I expected.\n\nHow it works\nAt a high level, this shortcut does three things:\n\nStores a book list inside the shortcut (so I can select a title quickly without typing)\nOn “Start”, saves the start timestamp to a small .txt file (stored in the Shortcuts folder on iCloud)\nOn “Stop”, creates a Calendar event using:\n\nEvent title: the selected book title\n\nStart time: retrieved from the saved .txt file\n\nEnd time: the current time when I stop the shortcut\n\n\n\n\nWhy it works surprisingly well\n\nCalendar events already contain the two key fields I need: start and end\nIt’s easy to attach metadata like book title through Shortcuts\nReviewing and correcting sessions is simple—each session is just an editable event in the Calendar\nCalendar sync is automatic across devices, including Apple Watch (a major constraint solved)\nExporting to .ics is standard and reliable; R has dedicated package to retrieve data from .ics\nA dedicated calendar keeps the dataset clean (no mixing with real appointments)\nThe same approach can be reused for other activities and hobbies (like drawing) with almost no changes\n\nWhat I like most is that it fits naturally into how I already use Calendar. I’m not trying to quantify reading habit as a tool for self-discipline. Instead, I’m more interested in seeing how reading shows up in my life—-when it happens, how consistent or inconsistent it is, and how my reading time spreads across different books and genres. Having sessions appear on my calendar makes reading time more visible, and it gives me a gentle, non-rigid way to notice patterns over time–patterns that will likely help me understand myself a little better in the future."

    "section": "Reflections",
    "text": "Reflections\nI will talk about the data export from Calendar and analysis in R in details in the next post. Here, I want to pause and share a few reflections from the process itself – what surprised me, what helped, and what I’d do again.\n\nShorcuts learning curve\nInitially, I went back and forth on whether I should use existing tools to build this time-tracking workflow or take the more ambitious route and try to build an app. The app idea might sound unrealistic for someone without a software engineering background, but I’ve always liked learning new things, and this felt like a good excuse/motive to try. With today’s AI coding tools, the question isn’t really whether it’s possible, but how much time I’d be willing to invest.\nIn the end, I chose the first route—using Shortcuts—because I wanted the process to be relatively quick and less demanding. If the project took too long, it would start stealing time from the very thing I was trying to support: reading. Shortcuts felt like a good middle ground: versatile enough to make life easier, but lightweight enough to keep the effort proportional to the goal. I’m still interested in building a small app one day—just not for this project, and not right now.\nAt work, I’ve built quite a few automated workflows using tools like Power Automate, AppleScript, and R. So when I first started exploring Shortcuts, I didn’t expect much of a learning curve. I assumed I could follow a set of steps and get a working shortcut quickly.\nThat confidence didn’t last long.\nMy first attempt failed pretty dramatically, and it took me at least two hours to accept that I needed to step back and look at real examples before I could build something reliable. In hindsight, the learning curve makes sense. It came from a few places:\n\nThe action vocabulary is its own world. Shortcuts has a specific set of building blocks, and you only get fluent by learning what exists (and what doesn’t).\nEach action has a narrow “shape.” Compared with tools like Power Automate (not a perfect comparison, but still), Shortcuts can feel more constrained in what each step can do—so you often need extra steps to get to the same result.\nThe environment is different. I’m much more practiced at building automation on a laptop. Designing something that needs to run smoothly on an iPhone—and especially on an Apple Watch—forced me to think differently about interaction, input, and friction.\n\n\n\nTalking through an idea really helps\nI still can’t believe the turning point came from a casual after-dinner conversation with my husband. I was explaining why my day felt rough—multiple failed Shortcut attempts—and what I had managed to achieve so far. I mentioned that I’d seen someone use Calendar as the “database” for time tracking. He asked a simple question: how does that work? And that question exposed a gap I hadn’t even noticed—I’d never really tested the Calendar option, and I wasn’t sure whether (or how) I could export all events from a dedicated calendar in a usable way.\nThat was the moment the solution clicked.\nThe turning point didn’t happen when I asked ChatGPT a hundred questions, and it didn’t happen when I collected more Shortcut examples. It happened when I tried to explain the problem out loud to another person.\nThis learning-by-teaching idea isn’t new—it’s a well-studied learning strategy. One related finding is the protégé effect: when learners expect to teach (or feel responsible for someone else’s learning), they often invest more effort and learn more deeply (Chase et al., 2009). In classroom settings, a widely used cousin of this idea is Peer Instruction, an evidence-based approach with a large research base across STEM disciplines (Vickrey et al., 2015). A closely related mechanism is self-explanation—putting your reasoning into words as you learn—which has also been shown to improve understanding even with minimal prompting (Chi et al., 1994).\nIn other words, when you try to teach—or even just explain—your thinking, you’re forced to organize it, name the assumptions you’ve been making, and notice what you don’t actually understand yet. Often, the “aha” comes not from new information, but from restructuring what you already know.\nOn the other side of the story, my husband was being a really good listener. It reminded me of what good therapists often do: ask the right questions, hold the space, and help people arrive at their own answers.\n\n\nThis work is licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0"
