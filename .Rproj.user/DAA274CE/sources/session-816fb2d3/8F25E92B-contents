title: "Kindly Measured"

Kindly Measured is a small collection of things I’ve explored and enjoyed in daily life. I like treating everyday life as something you can observe with both warmth and precision, so I often pair notes and reflections with simple data—time logs, progress trackers, and small experiments. Looking through a data lens helps me notice patterns I might otherwise miss, ask better questions, challenge myself gently, and understand this beautiful yet confusing world a little more clearly.
