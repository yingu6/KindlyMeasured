## Hypotheses to Explore (What I’m Curious About)

Now that I reviewed what data are available to me, the next step is deciding what I want to learn—and what additional data (if any) would make the analysis more meaningful.

Below is a list of questions I’m interested in answering. Most of them come with implicit assumptions about my reading habits. By collecting my own data and analyse them, I can see which assumptions hold up and which don't. I also hope to find a few patterns that I didn't anticipate. That’s what I enjoy the most about a data-driven approach: it can surface patterns I wouldn’t notice otherwise, and it helps me check my own biases with something more concrete than memory.

### When do I read?

First, I want to know some basic, time-related stats. 

1. **Consistency:** Do I read regularly, or in bursts?
2. **Timing:** What times of day does reading naturally happen?
3. **Weekday vs weekend:** Does reading cluster on certain days?
4. **Seasonality:** Are there any month-to-month (or seasonal) shifts? 

### How do I move through books?

These focus on how I move through books. Some of these require basic book metadata (e.g., genre, length), which I’ll add later.

#### For books I finish

1. **Book overview:** How many books did I read, what genres were they, and how long did each one take?
2. **Focus vs. switching:** Do I tend to read one book at a time, or bounce between several?
3. **Pace by book:** How long does it typically take me to finish a book (total hours and number of sessions)?
4. **Engagement pattern:** Which books show many short sessions vs. fewer long sessions?
5. **Switching behavior:** If I switch books mid-stream, is it random—or does it happen after long gaps, short sessions, or late-night reading?
6. **Genre differences:** Do I read certain genres at different times of day or in different session lengths?

#### For books I don't finish

1. **Abandonment point:** How far do I typically get before stopping? 
2. **The “fade-out” signal:** Do unfinished books show a common pattern before I drop them (shrinking session length, longer gaps, switching to other books)?

### What predicts momentum?

1. **What predicts “stickiness":** What factors correlate with steady progress—time of day, session length, weekday/weekend, or genre?
2. **Completion likelihood:** Are some genres more likely to be finished vs. abandoned?
