I like treating everyday life as something you can observe with both warmth and precision, so I often pair notes and reflections with simple data—time logs, progress trackers, and small experiments. Looking through a data lens helps me notice patterns I might otherwise miss, ask better questions, challenge myself gently, and understand this beautiful yet confusing world a little more clearly."

    "text": "I’ve been using a Kindle for reading and Goodreads for reviews and logging. But neither gives me the kind of session-level data (or metadata) I want to understand my reading habits over time.\nWhat I really wanted was a simple tracker that could capture:\nAfter looking into what was already available, I found that popular reading tracker apps (like Bookly and Bookmory) still didn’t fully meet my needs—both in design and in how accessible the data was—unless I paid for a subscription. And since the data I wanted felt fairly minimal, I started wondering: could I build something lightweight that stays local and gives me full control?\nAfter talking it through with ChatGPT, I decided to try a route that’s already built into the Apple ecosystem: Shortcuts, which works across iPhone and Apple Watch.\nThis post documents the path I took—complete with a few zigzags—the setup that actually stuck, and the reflections I had along the way.\nBook: The Kite Runner Start at 2025-12-29T18:39:24-05:00 Stop at 2025-12-29T18:39:29-05:00 —— Book: The Story of a New Name Start at 2025-12-29T19:28:27-05:00 Stop at 2025-12-29T19:28:30-05:00 ——\nFrom a data perspective, this wasn’t too bad. If I logged one reading session per day, I’d end up with roughly 365 × 6 = 2,190 lines by the end of the year. In theory, I could copy the note into R and run a parsing script built around this structure.\nStill, my data instincts kept nagging at me: this can’t be the best way. The format felt not only rudimentary but also fragile—easy to break if I ever tweaked the wording, missed a line, or wanted to add one more field later.\nSo I kept digging and tried another approach."

    "text": "Reflections\nI will talk about the data export from Calendar and analysis in R in details in the next post. Here, I want to pause and share a few reflections from the process itself – what surprised me, what helped, and what I’d do again.\n\nFirst-Timer with Shortcuts\nInitially, I went back and forth on whether I should use existing tools to build this time-tracking workflow or take the more ambitious route and try to build an app. The app idea might sound unrealistic for someone without a software engineering background, but I’ve always liked learning new things, and this felt like a good excuse/motive to try. With today’s AI coding tools, the question isn’t really whether it’s possible, but how much time I’d be willing to invest.\nIn the end, I chose the first route—using Shortcuts—because I wanted the process to be relatively quick and less demanding. If the project took too long, it would start stealing time from the very thing I was trying to support: reading. Shortcuts felt like a good middle ground: versatile enough to make life easier, but lightweight enough to keep the effort proportional to the goal. I’m still interested in building a small app one day—just not for this project, and not right now.\nAt work, I’ve built quite a few automated workflows using tools like Power Automate, AppleScript, and R. So when I first started exploring Shortcuts, I didn’t expect much of a learning curve. I assumed I could follow a set of steps and get a working shortcut quickly.\nThat confidence didn’t last long.\nMy first attempt failed pretty dramatically, and it took me at least two hours to accept that I needed to step back and look at real examples before I could build something reliable. In hindsight, the learning curve makes sense. It came from a few places:\n\nThe action vocabulary is its own world. Shortcuts has a specific set of building blocks, and you only get fluent by learning what exists (and what doesn’t).\nEach action has a narrow “shape.” Compared with tools like Power Automate (not a perfect comparison, but still), Shortcuts can feel more constrained in what each step can do—so you often need extra steps to get to the same result.\nThe environment is different. I’m much more practiced at building automation on a laptop. Designing something that needs to run smoothly on an iPhone—and especially on an Apple Watch—forced me to think differently about interaction, input, and friction.\n\n\n\nTalking through an idea really helps\nI still can’t believe the turning point came from a casual after-dinner conversation with my husband. I was explaining why my day felt rough—multiple failed Shortcut attempts—and what I had managed to achieve so far. I mentioned that I’d seen someone use Calendar as the “database” for time tracking. He asked a simple question: how does that work? And that question exposed a gap I hadn’t even noticed—I’d never really tested the Calendar option, and I wasn’t sure whether (or how) I could export all events from a dedicated calendar in a usable way.\nThat was the moment the solution clicked.\nThe turning point didn’t happen when I asked ChatGPT a hundred questions, and it didn’t happen when I collected more Shortcut examples. It happened when I tried to explain the problem out loud to another person.\nThis learning-by-teaching idea isn’t new. In fact, it’s a well-studied learning strategy in education research. Studies and reviews show that when learners expect to teach, prepare to teach, or actually teach, they often process material more deeply (sometimes called the protégé effect). oai_citation:0‡ADS Related approaches are also widely used in teaching practice—especially in STEM—such as Peer Instruction, an evidence-based pedagogy with a large research base across disciplines. oai_citation:1‡PMC A closely related mechanism is self-explanation: putting your reasoning into words forces you to organize ideas, surface assumptions, and notice gaps in understanding. oai_citation:2‡ScienceDirect\nIn other words, when you try to teach—or even just explain—your thinking, you’re forced to organize it, name the assumptions you’ve been making, and notice what you don’t actually understand yet. Often, the “aha” comes not from new information, but from restructuring what you already know.\nOn the other side of the story, my husband was being a really good listener. It reminded me of what good therapists often do: ask the right questions, hold the space, and help people arrive at their own answers."
